# Official Declaration of Prior Art: #cachetag™
**Original Effective Date:** November 17, 2025
**Architect and Author:** Dena Lawless
**Technical Contributor:** Abe Jarrett (Validation/Initial Scope)

### 1. Purpose of Declaration
This document serves as a public, time-stamped record of the #cachetag protocol architecture. It establishes ownership and "Prior Art" status to prevent the unauthorized patenting or claiming of similar semantic addressing methodologies within Large Language Model (LLM) infrastructures.

### 2. Architectural Claims
The #cachetag protocol is defined by the following unique technical characteristics:

* **Deterministic Semantic Addressing:** A method for tagging static data blocks within a continuous prompt stream to ensure specific KV-cache hits.
* **Namespace Isolation Logic:** A proprietary structure for preventing token collisions and memory bleed in multi-user or multi-agent environments.
* **Regex-Driven Segmentation:** A stateless, computationally efficient approach to identifying "bookmarks" within a 150k+ line "haystack" without requiring secondary LLM pre-processing.
* **Static/Dynamic Decoupling:** The logic for separating permanent reference material (the #cachetag) from ephemeral user queries to maximize token re-use and minimize compute overhead.

### 3. Legal Status
This architecture was finalized as a conceptual and functional framework on November 17, 2025. All rights to the logic, naming conventions, and implementation methods are reserved by the Lead Architect.
